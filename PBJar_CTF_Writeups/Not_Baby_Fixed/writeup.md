# Challenge Info:

#### Challenge Name: Not_Baby_Fixed

#### Challenge Author: QuickMaffs

#### Challenge Description: Hmm.... What is this? (Note: Not_Baby has a different solution than intended)

#### Files Provided: out.txt | nums.txt | script.py

# TLDR:
#### - Factor a, b, c and use substitution to rewrite the equation for n to only have 2 (known) variables rather than 3.
#### - Factor your new polynomial into 2 smaller factors, plug-in your variables and solve for those 2 factors.
#### - Use a factoring calculator to get all the prime factors of your two smaller n factors, easier than doing entire big n value.
#### - Standard RSA now: Calculate phi, then d, then m, and finally get the flag.

# In-Depth Solution: 

#### So after looking through the files we have provided we can see that script.py reads in flag.txt and nums.txt and then generates out.txt. Out.txt prints out an n value, e value, and ct value so we know this is RSA. A lot of other solutions that I found for this challenge used factor calculators for a long time or factorDB now that someone uploaded the factors into it. However that's cringe and we like to do the intended solution around here ðŸ˜Ž. (Note: I did talk to the challenge author and this method is the intended sol). 

#### So first we have to figure out how to factor n into prime factors so that we can proceed with the RSA decryption process. However, n is supposed to be too large to factor so we must use other methods then simply factor calculators. We do know however from script.py that the way n is generated makes this equation:

`n = a^3 + b^3 - 34c^3` 

#### and we know all the values of a b and c from nums.txt. *Btw the reason this challenge had to be "fixed" is that the original Not_Baby accidentally didn't provide nums.txt so it was "supposedly" impossible but people just ran factor calculators for 2 hours to solve it.* Anyways, knowing a, b, and c we can try to break up this equation/polynomial or whatever you want to call it to make factoring n more feasible. So we can use any big factorization calculator like alpertron or factorDB to start factoring a, b, and c (I used factorDB). Eventually you'll find that a and c have a large, prime common factor and that b and c also have a large, prime common factor. We can then rewrite a, b, and c using these two large factors we found, lets call them x and y. 

`a = 15x^2, b = 7y^2, c = 3xy where x = 321329349024937022728435772726127082487 and y = 302518462040600437690188095770599287567`

#### Knowing that n = a^3 + b^3 - 34c^3, we can know plug-in the values we have calculated and make a new two-variable equation which looks like this: 

`3375x^6 + 343y^6 - 918x^3y^3`

#### Now we have a two-vairable equation/polynomial so we can try to factor it out now. You can use something like sage for this but I was lazy and found this website that factored it for me: https://quickmath.com/webMathematica3/quickmath/algebra/factor/basic.jsp. The two resulting factors we get are: 

`(15x^2 + 3xy + 7y^2)(225x^4 - 45x^3y - 96x^2y^2 - 21xy^3 + 49y^4)`

#### Now we have successfully split n into two smaller factors, yay. Rather than mutliplying out those polynomials by hand we can write a script to do it for us.

```python
x = 321329349024937022728435772726127082487
y = 302518462040600437690188095770599287567

f = 15*x**2 + 3*x*y + 7*y**2
g = 225*x**4 - 45*x**3*y - 96*x**2*y**2 - 21*x*y**3 + 49*y**4

print(f)
print(g)
```

#### Now that we have two smaller numbers that we know are the products of n we can begin to prime factorize them, which will be much faster and more efficient than an incredibly large n value. Using factorDB I was able to get a long list of only prime factors that all multiply to get n. Time to write our script and decrypt this RSA now that the hard part is over. I will post my full script in this folder but I will give a brief explanation of it here. After calculating f and g I create an array of all the prime factors and call it nums. 

```python
nums = [9, 5, 71, 103, 50543, 190026430624001, 2703970397964298301, 2612704207743743498414225576245857791, 8581, 9202842813283520053373814153366196725555378670569425651403981961003320229089581578132314718638828971883763395128536959296142080739168256752552585624307]
```

#### I then calculate phi by multiplying all of the factors - 1 by each other. (Note: Will explain why this won't always work). 

```python
phi = 1
for num in nums:
	phi *= (num - 1)
```

#### Then I just calculate d value with standard RSA, so e^-1 mod phi. I think this can also be achieved with the pycrypto inverse function with inverse (e, phi). 

```python
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
```

#### Then find the message, again with standard RSA protocol, so our cyphertext^d mod n. 

```python
m = pow(ct, d, n)
```

#### Then I just run the long_to_bytes function to convert the message from numbers to readable text and voila, we have our flag. 

```python
flag = long_to_bytes(m)
print(flag)
```

#### Quickly to explain my previous note the phi function isn't calculated simply by getting the product of every prime factor - 1 it is actually calculated wtih:

`phi(p^e) = p^(e-1) * (p-1) p being the prime and e being the exponent`

#### Sometimes though you won't get any primes with an exponent > 1 so the beginning part of the phi function which is p^(e-1) will just end up equalling 1, so all you have to really solve for is (p-1). In this problem there was a prime factor of 2^4, but I was too lazy to write an actually good script so when I solved the phi function by hand with 2^4 I found that it would end up multiplying phi by 8, so in my nums array I just lazily added a factor of 9 so that when phi was multiplied by (num - 1) the 9 would multiply phi by 8. If you want a much better way of doing this I'd recommend checking out https://hackmd.io/Dy_A6F9fQTikEtHMEKcZ1Q?view this persons write-up has a much better and more dynamic way to calculate phi that will work with multiple factors with exponents > 1. Also funny enough this was the only write-up I could find that solved the challenge with the intended solution so kudos to them. However, as a beginner reading that write-up I thought it could use a little more explanation to help beginners trying to learn which I tried to achieve in this write-up. 

#### Anyways I'm done blabbering now here's the flag that is printed when I run my solve.py script.
