**Challenge Description:** Are you as good as Rainbolt at GeoGuessr? Prove your skills by geo-guessing these 17 countries.

# Solution: 

To begin I'd like to say this was a very creative and enjoyable challenge so thank you jazzzooo. I know a lot of people had fun with it, but also there was a lot of frustration which is why I wanted to make this writeup. Hope this help!

Before getting into the images, I'd like to talk about some important resources that are key to solving this challenge and ones I will be referencing throughout the writeup. I didn't know about any of the following resources (except Google Lens) before I started this challenge and I think one thing that helped me find these was having a GeoGuessr perspective going into the challenge rather than a CTF Osint perspective if that makes any sense. There are many resources specifically made for GeoGuessr because of the popularity of the game and the insane lengths people go to study for it (like Rainbolt), so I think utilizing said resources is a must. Anyways here's the list:
* https://geohints.com/ : This website has an extensive amount of images for different categories of objects you can find in images. It is also very easy to use and well organized, so I highly recommend.
* https://somerandomstuff1.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/geoguessr-the-top-tips-tricks-and-techniques/ : This site is not as nicely organized, but contains an extremely large amount of info. Ctrl+F definitely helps :wink:
* http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/ : Very detailed site, but only for license plates. However, I believe these are some of the most common and most helpful clues when going through these images.
* https://www.google.com/ : Finally without Google lens/Search By Image this challenge would be near impossible. There are also many other reverse image searchers online which work well, but I prefer Google Lens because of how reliable and accessible it is.

Finally, if you don't know the rules for creating the flag they are the following:
```Figure out in which country each image was taken.
The first letter of every country's name will create the flag.
Countries with over 10 million inhabitants will have a capital letter.
Countries with less than one million inhabitants become an underscore.
```

Now let's GeoGuessr some images!

### Image 1:

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212567949-e80f3b0e-138d-4131-9ab7-860d6fc2d911.png)

I don't think there is much to explain here as this is the easiest image. In the center of the image is one of the world's most recognizable statues, Christ the Redeemer. I think it is also considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Anyways this is a definitive icon of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, so this image gives us a B. Also we will capitalize this as Brazil most definitely has a population > 10 million.

### Image 2:

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212568115-e4750499-089a-4c50-9b06-efbbef4e076a.png)

This is another very definitive image. In the center of the image is a beautiful cathedral. This style is actually called Onion Dome TIL. This is very typical of Russian Orthodox churches and Russian architecture in general. The Cyrillic on the sign to the left also confirms Russia. If you're still doubtful reverse image search will show you this is Saint Basil's Cathedral and on the right the Spasskaya Tower. This will give us a capital R for Russia.

### Image 3:

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212568261-e44d6b90-369c-4cf3-9f32-9eea923f0476.png)

At first, this image is not as obvious as the first two however we see a brown sign with the word Kalamaja which when googled is a neighbourhood in Estonia. If you're still not convinced, reverse image searching the glass buildings on the right tells us it is the Office building of Tallink in Estonia. This gives us a lowercase e for Estonia due to its population of just over 1 million.

### Image 4:

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212568381-056ec9f3-e8d6-492c-8cb9-0d87148f743b.png)

This image can seem very intimidating at first, however we are given more info than you may think. White sidelines helps narrow it down slightly but isn't enough. The skinny white bollard with a thin red strip in the middle narrows down our search even more. You can find a section for Bollards on geohints. Combine all of this with the red colored soil and landscape this is enough to say Australia. However, if you still aren't convinced, reverse image searching the tall plant in the middle of the image tells us it is a Eucalyptus ceracea which is I quote: "endemic to a small area in the north of Western Australia". This will give us a capital A for Australia.

### Image 5:

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212568599-a7caaa85-53ae-4282-8a6b-979dc9ea8004.png)

This image is pretty deceiving. There seems to be an extremely large amount of clues and info, but this only fuels the deception. First of all we know we are in some Muslim or Arabic country. There is writing like Al-Siraad Plaza, Al-Furqan, Peri Peri Pizza, and Third Street but the names are actually generic enough to not be helpful. One thing that helps narrow it down quickly is driving on the left side. If you didn't notice this at first please look again. Cars are parked on the left side and driving left. Geohints gives us a nice map of countries that drive on the left. This takes away essentially the entire Middle East, but it could still be South Asian countries like Pakistan or East African countries.
For me the final nail in the coffin is license plates. The yellow license plates in the back are very obvious, but one thing you may not have noticed is that license plates are actually white in the front. There is one car visible facing the camera in the middle of the screen and zooming in on the license plate shows all white and no yellow. Thus combining geohints's map of left driving side and world license plates the only country possible is Kenya. Kenya has white in the front yellow in the back, drives on the left side, and a non negligible Muslim population. Again I think many here would be deceived and thought South Asian countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka, but you can find such Islamic neighborhoods everywhere. So the fine details are key here. This gives our answer a capital K for Kenya.

### Image 6:

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212568872-47fd9b4f-706e-4220-a4a1-cbbf92f491e5.png)

This is a pretty barren looking image, but quite easy. White lines in the middle plus yellow bollards with some white on the top can immediately lead you to Iceland. Combine this with the fairly flat landscape and mountains in the background confirms this. If you're still not convinced just reverse image search the whole thing and you'll get a very definitive Iceland. This image will give us an underscore for Iceland's low population.

### Image 7:

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569000-5538c099-b3a5-4e05-bf8c-0a59c2552135.png)

This image shows a very small road, so we aren't really able to use bollards, lines, or driving directions. Instead the two biggest clues is architecture and the license plate visible with very few characters. By architecture, I mostly am referring to the two white yurts visible in the image. Reverse image searching these very quickly gives us Mongolia and geohints confirms this in their Architecture section. If you're still curious this is in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. If you want to explore for yourself it is slightly North of the Khoroo 17 neighborhood. This will give us a lowercase m for Mongolia.

### Image 8:

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569196-6f6620ae-bbb0-4577-86a4-97a1df6f07ae.png)

This is another extremely deceiving image. At first glance I was convinced this was Europe. The white houses with red roofs are just so characteristic. However this is more deception. The only reliable method I ended up getting for this question was reverse image search. However, I didn't search the whole image. I cropped it like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569271-e14518af-27a8-428c-a610-f27b5a343833.png)
Google then spit out Swaziland for me. However, the country's official name is Eswatini so this will give us a lowercase e. *Swaziland sounds so much cooler tho :sob:*

### Image 9:

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569398-10a269d6-6543-4198-b8cb-0be7f7fbdce3.png)

This image actually isn't too bad. We can see the city is extremely distinct with skyscrapers and an elevated landscape in the background. However what caught my eye was this building:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569424-433cdd69-3aac-4134-871e-a80a13719b94.png)
It looked super distinct, so throw it into Google Lens and it will quickly spit out the Op√©ra de Stephen Monte-Carlo. This tells us it is in the waters of Monaco overlooking Monte-Carlo. So this gives us an underscore due to Monaco's very small population.

### Image 10:

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569494-4442bcfa-6b38-435a-851c-b7b815b34aea.png)

This image can be done very quickly. Looking at the house to the left with green window covers we see two Swiss flags. If you're still not convinced just reverse image search and get Switzerland. This ends up giving us a lowercase s for Switzerland.

### Image 11:

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569542-a737b9e4-c4e4-4264-821b-a57d889bda05.png)

This image shows us a lot of road which is always nice. White sidelines and middle lines narrows it down quickly with geohints. Finally, the white and red bollards for me narrowed it down to either Ukraine or Poland. I was a little back and forth on this one for a while. But combined with Google Lens and me being a LudBud... "those trees look Polish". This will give us a capital P for Poland.

### Image 12:

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569623-36130ad1-909c-4921-a4e8-ee39a3b2a36b.png)

This image has a lot of visible writing. The red text on yellow signs shows us this must be German speaking. This could really only be Germany, Austria, or parts of Switzerland I believe. However, there is also a small red sign on the right side with white text:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569657-bbc1b322-9bea-4e71-a3f1-7f44de35090d.png)
It is a little hard to read but it says: Nikolaus-Dumba-Stra√üe, which googling that quickly gives us Austria. This image will give us a lowercase a for Austria.

### Image 13:

![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569763-12955015-ff39-4913-9eb9-a8c3d111d901.png)

This image can quickly be narrowed down by white sidelines and yellow middle lines. The landscape reminded me of Northern Hemisphere though. Reverse image searching this will give a lot of Canada which is the answer. I could see this being confused with the Northern United States as well though. This image will give us a capital C for Canada.

### Image 14:

![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212569887-b0a392c0-c015-41ff-9086-0834cbebfe0f.png)

From first glance this reminded me of South America or something like Indonesia. But we can actually see the truck is driving on the right side so this must be South America. Additionally the road name has an accented i that is seen in Spanish or Portuguese. The black on yellow chevrons can help narrow it down even further with geohints. The final clue for me was the Orange license plate that is mentioned in the random geoguessr tips and tricks article. This must be Ecuador which gives us a capital E.

### Image 15:

![15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212570061-332adf60-8978-49dc-80a9-a4c79d2fcd0d.png)

So this is initially narrowed down greatly due to the Cyrillic writing on the KMA trash can. Some articles for geoguessr actually say this is very typical for Bulgaria. Then combined with reverse image searching the building on the right confirms Bulgaria. This image will give us a lowercase b for Bulgaria.

### Image 16:

![16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212570295-cd5813a6-a3ac-41a7-b771-96b0db54c4b2.png)

This image is actually much easier than it seems. White lines on the outside combined with the white on black chevron on geohints immediately narrows it down to basically only Albania or Switzerland. The clue that actually confirmed this image was the rift that can be seen at the top middle of the image. Geohints has a section for rifts and going through it I could see Albania has very distinctive rifts that resemble what is seen in the image. So this image will give us a lowercase a for Albania.

### Image 17:

![17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91157382/212570310-80d6db81-55c6-4914-a1c3-61644b68f3b4.png)

I will say this image is pretty tough. There weren't any distinctive clues I was able to use to find this. Basically I kept trying reverse image searching different parts and I was getting Russia a lot. I believe this is Yuzhno-Kurilsk, an urban locality in Russia. If you think this is still a bit far-fetched guessing please read my final notes that are also a big part of this challenge. This image will give us a capital R for Russia just like image 2.

### Ending note: 

I do want to say an important part of this challenge was the flag that was being created throughout the challenge. One tactic that I think would help is compiling all of your guesses into a list and viewing your resulting flag. We were still missing about 4-5 countries at some point and my teammate threw out a guess: "Maybe it spells Break_my_spacebar". We laughed at the guess at first, but it ended up being only one letter off. So if you had situations like Ukraine vs Poland or Canada vs USA, compiling such a list and seeing words form can help you fill in the final gaps of 2 or 3 countries.
Anyways I hope this writeup helped you. If so or you see any issues with this writeup please dm me at Rench#9671 on Discord. Thanks for reading!
